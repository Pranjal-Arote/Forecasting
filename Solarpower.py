Solar power consumption has been recorded by city councils at regular 
intervals. The reason behind doing so is to understand how businesses are 
using solar power so that they can cut down on nonrenewable sources of energy 
and shift towards renewable energy. Based on the data, build a forecasting 
model and provide insights on it.
